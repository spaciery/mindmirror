# AWS CloudFormation

With **AWS CloudFormation**, you can treat your infrastructure as code. This means that you can  build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.

AWS CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, enabling you to frequently build your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions. It determines the right operations to perform when managing your stack and rolls back changes 
automatically if it detects errors.
